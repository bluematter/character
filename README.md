# PROJECT_NAME (Working Title)

*A perpetual, on-chain, community-owned AI character studio inspired by Nouns — built for culture, storytelling, and internet-native creativity.*

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

PROJECT_NAME is a protocol that **creates one new AI-native character at a fixed cadence (daily or weekly)**.

Each character is:
- visually generated using AI
- given lore, voice, and personality
- added to a shared universe
- permanently part of the ecosystem
- contributing to a **treasury that funds culture**

The community governs how the universe evolves:
- content
- collaborations
- stunts
- storytelling
- product expansions
- worldbuilding

Not just NFTs.
Not just tokens.
A **living cultural machine**.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a **long-lasting cultural brand**, not a pump-and-dump project  
- Merge **AI + crypto + creator economy + storytelling**  
- Allow a community to **fund creativity at scale**  
- Make governance feel like running a **fun creative studio**, not a chore  
- Be **crypto-native**, not dependent on Visa/Mastercard rails  

---

## 🌍 Philosophy

PROJECT_NAME believes:
- Characters are **IP primitives**
- Stories are **network effects**
- Culture beats pure speculation
- Ownership unlocks participation
- Internet weirdness is a feature, not a bug

---

## 🏗 System Overview

### 1️⃣ Character Minting Protocol

- One character is born on-chain at a recurring cadence
- Minting mechanism similar to Nouns:
  - Cadence-based auction or mint
  - Ownership = governance + cultural participation
- Metadata includes:
  - Name
  - Personality traits
  - Lore + backstory
  - Visual identity
  - Voice / tone style
  - Thematic category (e.g., realm/world tag)

Auction proceeds → Treasury.

---

### 2️⃣ Treasury

The treasury is owned collectively and funds:

- creators
- developers
- cultural stunts
- marketing
- content productions
- collaborations
- expansions
- real-world activations

The question always:
> Does this push the PROJECT_NAME universe forward?

Transparency and purpose-driven spending are key.

---

### 3️⃣ Governance

Governance should feel like:

🎬 Running a creative studio  
🎨 Collaborating on worlds  
📺 Producing ongoing content  
🎭 Directing character arcs  

Not boring DAO hell.

#### Governance Powers

- Approve budget proposals
- Fund creative missions
- Decide world expansions
- Drive character spotlighting
- Approve collabs & partnerships
- Shape storyline direction

#### Proposal Types

- Content Grants
- Product / Feature Development
- Lore / World Development
- Marketing / Growth
- IRL Initiatives
- Treasury Strategy

Governance should be:
- simple  
- playful  
- meaningful

### 4️⃣ Content Engine

This is where the project differentiates.

Each character isn’t static – it’s **alive**.

- AI-generated art
- Short video content
- TikTok / Reels / social output
- Meme templates
- Lore expansion tools
- Possible voice + performance
- Ability to co-star with other characters

Community can:
- remix
- co-create
- animate arcs
- build spin-offs
- generate fan worlds

The ecosystem becomes a **living universe**, not frozen collectibles.

## 🔁 The Flywheel

1️⃣ Character is born  
2️⃣ Mint/auction funds treasury  
3️⃣ Treasury funds culture  
4️⃣ Culture creates attention  
5️⃣ Attention increases value & network  
6️⃣ Repeat forever

Mid-Term
