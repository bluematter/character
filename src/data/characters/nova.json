Instead of dimming down, they cranked it up to eleven and never looked back.\n\nThey've been kicked out of three art schools (for being too experimental), started two underground movements (one musical, one fashion), and have a reputation for turning boring situations into legendary stories.\n\nNova doesn't believe in doing things halfway. If you're going to exist, EXIST. If you're going to create, CREATE. If you're going to care about something, defend it with your whole chest. They joined Cosmic Friends because they heard it was supposed to be the future of something - and Nova always wants to be there when new things are being born.",
