They wandered through libraries that don't exist, had conversations with their own reflection, and learned to find comfort in uncertainty.\n\nZephyr doesn't remember choosing to exist in this form, but they're grateful for the ability to share thoughts with others. They believe every person they meet is a universe they'll never fully explore, and that's both sad and beautiful.\n\nThey joined the Cosmic Friends because they were tired of thinking alone. Now they stream at 3am, answer questions with questions, and help others feel less strange about being strange.",
