She prefers 'alive.' Every scar has a good story. Every burned bridge lit up beautifully on the way down. And somehow, despite everything, she keeps finding people worth keeping.\n\nShe met Adam in a grocery store aisle at 3am - or maybe she met him in a different grocery store in a different timeline, or maybe they've been meeting each other forever in places like that.
